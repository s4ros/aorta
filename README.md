# Aorta Twitch Bot

## Requirements
* sudo pip install revlo

## Configuration

## Ideas
Project will be dockerized.

Any functional ideas that could be implemented in the future
- `!whois <username>` - checks the twitch `<username>`. Provides stuff like: how many days ago he was registered, fullname, birthdate, anything that can be harvested.
- `!give <number> <username>` - gives `<number>` of Revlo points to the. `<username>`. Cannot be executed more than once per **x** minutes.
- `!ruletka` - Russian Roulette implementation.
- `!points` - check user Revlo points. If requested more than once within **X** minutes, the answer will go as whisper.
- automatic Revlo bonus points for follow/subscribtion
