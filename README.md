# Aorta Twitch Bot

## Where's the old bot?
I evolved and figured out how to do it more efficient :) However, you can still find my previous nasty code in a branch `first_attempt`. So, without further ado, I present you *AortaBot*, the new begining :D

Hope you'll enjoy :)

## Ideas
Project will be dockerized.

Any functional ideas that could be implemented in the future
- `!whois <username>` - checks the twitch `<username>`. Provides stuff like: how many days ago he was registered, fullname, birthdate, anything that can be harvested.
- `!give <number> <username>` - gives `<number>` of ~Revlo~ points to the. `<username>`. Cannot be executed more than once per **x** minutes.
- `!ruletka` - Russian Roulette implementation.
- `!points` - check user ~Revlo~ points. If requested more than once within **X** minutes, the answer will go as whisper.
- automatic ~Revlo~ bonus points for follow/subscribtion
